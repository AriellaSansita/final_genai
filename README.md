# Project Overview

This project is a Generative AI-powered web application built using the Gemini API and Streamlit. The system generates personalized fitness training plans, recovery-safe workouts, tactical advice, and nutrition suggestions based on a user’s sport, position, injury history, and fitness goals. The aim of this project is to make structured and safe coaching accessible to young athletes, especially those without access to professional trainers.

# Problem Statement

Many young athletes lack access to professional coaching, personalized training routines, and safe recovery guidance. This often leads to poor performance, incorrect training, and risk of injury. Generative AI can bridge this gap by providing adaptive, personalized, and safe training recommendations based on individual athlete needs.

# Objectives

- Develop an AI-powered fitness coaching web application using Generative AI

- Generate personalized workout and recovery plans

- Provide injury-safe training recommendations

- Offer tactical and nutrition guidance

- Build and deploy the application using Streamlit and Gemini API

# Research Summary

Research was conducted on sports-specific training, injury prevention, recovery-safe workouts, and AI-driven personalized coaching systems. Studies on AI in sports training and fitness recommendation systems helped shape the design of this project. The system focuses on generating safe, adaptive, and personalized training outputs for young athletes

# Model Configuration

The Gemini model was configured using different temperature settings depending on output type:

- Temperature = 0.3 for safe and structured workout plans

- Temperature = 0.7 for creative tactical and nutrition advice

Prompt structure and phrasing were refined through testing to improve response accuracy and personalization.

# Sample Outputs and Validation

The model was tested using different sports, positions, and injury conditions. Outputs were evaluated for safety, personalization, and relevance. Recovery-based prompts produced safe workout modifications, and training plans matched sport-specific requirements. Prompt phrasing and temperature settings were adjusted to improve clarity and accuracy of responses.

# Features of the Web App

-  input for sport, position, injury history, and goals

- AI-generated personalized workout plans

- Injury-safe training recommendations

- Tactical improvement suggestions

- Nutrition and hydration guidance

- Simple and user-friendly interface

# Deployment

The web application was developed using Streamlit and integrated with the Gemini API for AI-generated outputs. The project was uploaded to GitHub and deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
